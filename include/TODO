COMPLETELY REWRITE PARSER/NODE TREE THING

DESIGN A BETTER PARSE TREE FROM GROUND UP 
BASED ON BINARY SEARCH TREES


FUCK THIS DESIGN

Single Node object
has byte that if
 
 1 - Number Node
 0 - Binary Op Node

Has multiple constructors
one for number node
one for bin op node

FIX ALL CONSTRUCTORS NEEDED IN PARSER.CPP

I am too tired to fix it right now good night..
